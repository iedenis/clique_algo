# clique_algo
Clique Algo is an educational project which deals with finding cliques in a given vertex graph.

The project is based on an existing project and tries to take it a step forward by doing some code performance improving and expanding usage further on to inputting and outputting new graph formats.

### Tasks
* Performance improving existing code that searches maximal cliques based on DFS Algorithm for mpre information check [Clique problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clique_problem) on wikipedia.
* Searching the web for another suitable graph format and use it for reading, writing and solving the clique problem.

# Java profiler (Tested with two graphs each ~1000 vertices)
